# ReinforcementLearning
Collection of code I create as I learn about reinforcement learning in my spare time. I am currently following the following book: "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd ed" by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto

The Folder "Sandbox_Experiments" contains some python files exploring particular applications of reinforcement learning discussed in the book.
