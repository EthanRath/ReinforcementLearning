# ReinforcementLearning
Collection of code I create as I learn about reinforcement learning in my spare time. I am currently following the following book: http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf

The Folder "Sandbox_Experiments" contains some python files exploring particular applications of reinforcement learning discussed in the book.
